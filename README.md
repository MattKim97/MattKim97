<h1 align="center">Hi there I'm Matthew Kim!</h1>
<h4 align="left">I am a passionate software developer with a previous background in biological sciences research. I fell in love with coding due to the ability to solve puzzles and problems in many different ways, and that there is never a singular correct answer. I love solving puzzles and then comparing my solutions with others so that I can look at other solutions and what I might learn from them! I love working with both the front and back-end, and I believe that I can provide a myriad of different approaches to solving problems due to my previous backgrounds! </h4> 

- 🏢 I’m currently working at Dev10! 
 
- 🏫 I’m currently learning Golang and Java Studying!

- 🤔 Interested in C#, .Net Development, Vue, and Ruby.

- 📃 (AWS Certified) Developer Associate (DVA-C02)
